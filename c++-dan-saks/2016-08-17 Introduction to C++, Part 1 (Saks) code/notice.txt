Most folder names are in the form CC-XX:

-- CC is the number of a chapter.

-- XX is the number of the example in that chapter.

These folders containing coding examples from the notes.

Other folders correspond to programming exercises in the notes.

When solving an exercise, you rarely need to start from scratch. Rather,
you start the exercise by using the code from the immediately preceeding
folder.

Some exercises have more than one folder associated with it. If the folder
name ends with the letter 'p', you use the code in that folder to start
the exercise. If the folder has the letter 's' in it, it contains the
exercise solution. Some exercise have more than one solution, indicated by
.1, .2, etc., at the end of the folder name.

Each folders contain make files to build the program as a Windows console
application with these different compilers:

gcw.mk - TDM-GCC (as a C compiler) using mingw32-make

gpw.mk - TDM-GCC (as a C++ compiler) using mingw32-make

vcw.mk - Microsoft Visual 2015 (as a C compiler) using nmake

vpw.mk - Microsoft Visual 2015 (as a C++ compiler) using nmake
